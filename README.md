This was my second 'mostly' solo endeavour making an Android app on my own. Although I got the 'idea' for the app from a youtube series posted by 'Philipp Lackner' on youtube 
and also learned about pagination and some other things from the series but other than that it is mostly my implementation.

The architecture I used is -MVVM

The various technologies, libraries that are used are:-

1) Kotlin - The programming lang ( I seriously like the null check and safety feature here )
2) Navigation component- Damn the making nav graphs and connecting them is fun!
3) dagger hilt - for dependency injection
4) coroutines- For api request and room queries
5) retrofit2- For getting data from the api
6) room - for storing favourite articles of users into database
7) fresco- for loading images

This was a really awesome project and definitely helped me solidify my skills further!

Those who are really interested in making a somewhat useful project and learn more about mvvm and other components in general definitely check Philipp's channel out. Cannot recommend it 
enough.
