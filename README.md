# NewsApp
This app showcases the latest and trending news. Users can search and filter out the news that piques their interest. Users can also read the full news articles and save them locally in their phone for viewing later without internet connection. 

The architecture I used is -MVVM

The various technologies, libraries that are used are:-

1) Kotlin - The programming language
2) Navigation component
3) dagger hilt - for dependency injection
4) coroutines- For api request and room queries
5) retrofit2- For getting data from the api
6) room - for storing favourite articles of users into database
7) fresco- for loading images

This was a really awesome project and definitely helped me solidify my skills further!

The app currently is made for only light mode screens
